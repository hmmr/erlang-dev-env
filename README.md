# An erlang developer environment for non-Debian users

This is a quick and cheap developer environment for Erlang development,
with the absolute minimum of bells and whistles. It is based on
a standard `erlang:VSN` docker image (`VSN` being 22 at the time of
writing).

There are two sripts, `build` and `run`, which should be
self-explanatory.
